## SED Fitting

We provide the SED fitting results for a subset of sources within the compilation using CIGALE ([Boquien et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A.103B/abstract)) and LePHARE ([Arnouts et al. 1999](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999MNRAS.310..540A/abstract), [Ilbert et al. 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...457..841I/abstract)). The compilation is limited to only those that have COSMOS2020/Classic matches and a quality assessment flag of *Q<sub>f</sub>* = 3 and 4. We refer the user to the main compilation paper for a review of assumptions made in the SED fitting process.

Note that IDs in the SED result FITS files are the same as `Id_COS20_Classic` in the compilation. Users should do an *exact cross match* in order to link objects within the compilation with objects within the SED result FITS files.
